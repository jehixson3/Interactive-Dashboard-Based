Interactive Dashboard

This interactive dashboard is a full stack app that uses plotly.js to visualize belly button bacteria data in charts as well as displays the meta data on the choosen study particpant.  

The meta data for each particpant includes age, gender, location, ethnicity, belly button type, and the frequecny they wash their belly buttons per week.

The Pie Chart displays the bacteria and total percentage of bacteria for the choosen sample.  The information is displayed when the mouse is hovered over a slice.  Additionally, the top ten samples are listed and can also be used to mainpulate the data on the page by clicking a different sample ID.

The user is able to change the sample to update the charts and values to fully explore the dataset.  A bubble chart shows a list of bacteria found in the belly button samples as well as the sample value.  When the mouse is hovered over the bubble, this information is revealed.

The app.py script runs on localhost:8000.
